DeskThing is an application that serves a control interface to a Car Thing, 
phone, or any other computing device. It also can load official and community-developed 
apps to allow control over local audio, monitor discord, or even keep an eye on the weather!

Keep these terms in mind when reading the documentation.

**DeskThing Client** - The image displayed on the Car Thing or other device.

**DeskThing Server** - The application installed on a computer to interface with the client.

**DeskThing Apps** - Standalone applications installed to extend the functionality of DeskThing Server.
