## Known Issues

### App Local Not Found (is it running?)

Please remove the utility app. 

We don't like that app around these parts. The functionality was integrated into the base app in v0.9.0.

### Car Thing connects successfully but cannot play audio.

Navigate to settings (bottom left), set a playback location under the **Music** tab, and select save.


### **Getting Audio Data** / **Waiting For Song**
