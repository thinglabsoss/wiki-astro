    1.) Navigate to [thingify](https://thingify.tools/firmware/XVYO9TGFDVsPtIeTB3fc-/Gf6EZS1AKV_P1-3-bWrPH) and download "windows-bundled-version.number.here.zip".
   
    2.) Extract the windows-bundled.zip into an accessible location and navigate to the extracted directory.

    3.) Within the directory, double click the "flash.bat" file.

    <Aside type='note'>Make sure you can view file name extensions enabled with the Windows File Explorer.</Aside>
   
    4.) Wait for the flashing process to complete. If the installation fails with an error message stating "device not found", power cycle the device, enter back into USB burn mode, and try again.
    <Aside type='note'>You may notice that the data and setting file fail. These files are unnecessary and will not impact the flashing process.</Aside>
    <Aside type='caution'>A known issue has been identified regarding compatibility with the flashing tool and AMD 5000 series CPUs. AMD has been notified and possibly working on a fix. If you run into this issue, try updating your BIOS or try the flashing process a few times.</Aside>

    5.) After the flashing process completes, power cycle the car thing.
