    Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and python will be installed with it.

    Complete the following steps to connect the Car Thing to your computer and install the proper USB Drivers.
    
    1.) Plug in a USB-C-to-C or USB-A-to-C cable into the Car Thing Power Supply Port.

    2.) While holding top preset buttons 1 and 4, plug the USB into the computer. This will put the device into USB burning mode.

        <Aside type='caution'>Ensure your USB power supply and cable are capable of 
         passing data and providing ample power to the car thing.</Aside>

    3.) Install Zadig from [here](https://zadig.akeo.ie). This tool is used to modify the computer USB drivers.
   
    4.) After the driver is installed select options, then “list all devices”.

    5.) Within the drop-down change the select “GX-CHIP”. Select the "Edit" checkbox and replace the name with "WorldCup Device".

    <Aside type='caution'>This name is case sensitive!</Aside>

    6.) In the "Driver" field select the up or down arrows to cycle through the list of drivers. Press the up arrow until you see the option "libusbK".
    
    7.) Select "Replace Driver" and wait for it to finish. This can take several minutes.

    <Aside type='note'>If this driver does not work, try using the WinUSB driver instead.</Aside>

    To verify the driver has changed successfully, navigate to the windows device manager. You should find a drop down titled "libuse-win32 devices" and a device named "WorldCup Device"
