The Car Thing supports several open source operating systems that extend the life and functionality of the product. Look through the applications and see which is the best fit for you.
## Official Apps
### [DeskThing](https://deskthing.app/)
This is DeskThing. Using Spotify's existing Car Thing, the DeskThing makes the perfect desk assistant. The DeskThing serves as an alternative OS for the Spotify Car Thing. It allows you to load community-developed apps to allow control over local audio, monitor discord, or even keep an eye on the weather! This is an open source project by Riprod, an independant developer still in college! If you want to help contribute to this project and extend the life of your car thing, you can do so through my buymeacoffee link or through Github Sponsors.

### [Nocturne](https://github.com/usenocturne/nocturne-ui)

Unless receiving power through a Linux computer, running Nocturne on your Car Thing requires a host device such as a Raspberry Pi, a microSD card, a microUSB to USB-C cable, a microUSB/your power source's connector, as well as a Spotify Premium account.
