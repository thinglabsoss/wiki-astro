  ### Flashing with Terbium on Windows

    1.) Navigate to [thingify.tools](https://thingify.tools/firmware/P3QZbZIDWnp5m_azQFQqP?tab=versions), select the right arrow for the latest release, and select the download button to download "x.x.x-thinglabs.zip".
   
    2.) Extract the zip into an accessible location.
   
    3.) Navigate to [Terbium](https://terbium.app/).

    4.) Plug in a USB-C-to-C or USB-A-to-C cable into the Car Thing power supply USB-C port.

    5.) While holding top preset buttons 1 and 4, plug the USB into the computer. This will put the device into USB burn mode.

        <Aside type='caution'>Ensure the USB port power supply and cable are capable of 
         passing data and providing ample power to the car thing.</Aside>

    6.) Flashing the Car Thing from Windows USB drivers to be installed. From Windows PowerShell, send the following command:
    
    ```
    irm https://driver.terbium.app/get | iex
    ```
    <Aside type='note'>Having problems with the script? The Zadig application can also be used to load the WinUSB driver, see [Legacy - Setting Up](/legacy/setup-env).</Aside> 

    7.) Select the **Done** button. 

    8.) A popup should appear in the browser with a device listed as "GX-CHIP".

    <Aside type='note'>If no device is identified make sure the Car Thing is in USB burn mode, see step 5.</Aside> 

    9.) Select the device, then **Connect**.

    <Aside type='caution'>If the system has been used to flash Car Thing previously using a legacy method,
    an "Access Denied" error may appear. This is the result of incorrect drivers being installed. 
    To remove old drivers, open Windows Device Manager and look for either 
    "GX-CHIP" or "WorldCup" in the list of devices. If one of these devices is found, right click and select **Uninstall device**. 
    Next, select **Attempt to remove the driver for this device**. Finally, select **Uninstall**. This may need to be performed multiple times 
    to ensure all previous drivers are removed. If the GX-CHIP device shows a warning symbol, install the driver 
    again with the command in the described in step 6.</Aside>

    10.) The USB device will briefly reconnect, putting the device into burn mode. Select **Connect** again.
    
    11.) A popup should appear in the browser with the device now listed as "unknown device from Amlogic, Inc". Select the device, then **Connect**.
    
    12.) Once connected, select the button **Restore Local Folder**, navigate to the thingify.tools extracted zip directory, and select **Open**.

    13.) A popup should appear in the browser requesting access to view the directory. Give permission to the browser by selecting **View files**.

    14.) Select the **Select** button to start the flashing process.

    <Aside type='note'>Press **F12** on a keyboard to view the flashing logs. If
    an error occurs while attempting to flash, review the logs and provide them 
    in a support thread on the [ThingLabs_Discord](https://tl.mt/d).</Aside>

        **Congratulations! Your Car Thing is now flashed and ready to use with a ThingLabs or Community app.**
