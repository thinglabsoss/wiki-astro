This page provides step-by-step instructions for flashing the Spotify Car Thing with the Terbium webpage.
  
  ### Flashing with Terbium
    Complete the following steps to flash the Car Thing.
    
    1.) Navigate to [thingify.tools](https://thingify.tools/firmware/P3QZbZIDWnp5m_azQFQqP?tab=versions), select the arrow for the latest release, and select the download button to download "version.number.here-thinglabs.zip".
   
    2.) Extract the zip into an accessible location.
   
    3.) Navigate to [Terbium.app](https://terbium.app/)

    4.) Plug in a USB-C-to-C or USB-A-to-C cable into the Car Thing Power Supply USB-C Port.

    5.) While holding top preset buttons 1 and 4, plug the USB into the computer. This will put the device into USB burning mode.

        <Aside type='caution'>Ensure the USB port power supply and cable are capable of 
         passing data and providing ample power to the car thing.</Aside>

    6.) Select the **Done** button.

    7.) A new popup should appear with a device listed as "unknown device from Amlogic, Inc". Ensure that an adblock is not stopping this popup. 
    
    <Aside type='note'>If no device is identified, make sure the Car Thing is in USB burn mode, see steps 4 and 5.</Aside> 

    8.) Select the device, then **Connect**.

    <Aside type='caution'>If the system has been used to flash Car Thing previously using a legacy method
    an "Access Denied" error may appear. See the Terbium troubleshooting window
    for details on removing old drivers.</Aside>

    9.) Once connected, select the button **Restore Local Folder**, navigate to the thingify.tools extracted zip directory and select **Open**.
