This page provides step-by-step instructions for flashing the Spotify Car Thing with the ThingLabs OS using the Terbium webpage. A device running Linux or Mac can be used to flash the Car Thing, however Windows is the suggested platform.

  ### Flashing with Terbium
    Complete the following steps to flash the Car Thing.
    
    1.) Navigate to [thingify.tools](https://thingify.tools/firmware/P3QZbZIDWnp5m_azQFQqP?tab=versions), select the right arrow for the latest release, and select the download button to download "version.number.here-thinglabs.zip".
   
    2.) Extract the zip into an accessible location.
   
    3.) Navigate to [Terbium.app](https://terbium.app/)

    4.) Plug in a USB-C-to-C or USB-A-to-C cable into the Car Thing power supply USB-C port.

    5.) While holding top preset buttons 1 and 4, plug the USB into the computer. This will put the device into USB burn mode.

        <Aside type='caution'>Ensure the USB port power supply and cable are capable of 
         passing data and providing ample power to the car thing.</Aside>

    6.) Flashing the Car Thing from Windows requires special USB drivers. From Windows PowerShell, send the following command:
    
    ```
    irm https://driver.terbium.app/get | iex
    ```
    <Aside type='note'>Having problems with the script? The Zadig application can also be used to load the WinUSB driver, see [Legacy - Setting Up](/legacy/setup-env).</Aside> 

    7.) Select the **Done** button. 

    8.) A new popup should appear with a device listed as "GX-CHIP". Ensure that an adblock is not stopping this popup. 

    <Aside type='note'>If no device is identified make sure the Car Thing is in USB burn mode, see step 5.</Aside> 

    9.) Select the device, then **Connect**.

    10.) The USB device will briefly reconnect. Select **Connect** again.
    
    11.) A popup should appear with the device now listed as "unknown device from Amlogic, Inc". Select the device, then **Connect**.
    
    <Aside type='caution'>If the system has been used to flash Car Thing previously using a legacy method
    an "Access Denied" error may appear. To remove old drivers, open Windows Device Manager and look for either 
    "GX-CHIP" or "WorldCup" Device in the list of devices. When found, right click, click **Uninstall device** and 
    select **Attempt to remove the driver for this device**. Finally, click **Uninstall**. You may have to do this 
    multiple times to ensure all previous drivers are removed. If the GX-CHIP device shows a warning symbol, install the driver 
    again with the script in the previous section.</Aside>

    12.) Once connected, select the button **Restore Local Folder**, navigate to the thingify.tools extracted zip directory, and select **Open**.

    13.) A popup should appear requesting to let the site view the files, select **View files**.

    14.) Select the **Select** button to start the flashing process.

    <Aside type='note'>Press **F12** on a keyboard to view the flashing logs. If
    an error occurs while attempting to flash, review the logs and provide them 
    in a support thread on the DeskThing Discord.</Aside>
