This page is full of commonly asked general questions about Car Thing and flashing.
## Known Issues

### AMD 5000 series cards
For whatever reason AMD hasn't fixed their USB issue. A few people have had luck with a BIOS update - but the easiest way is to just set it up with another computer

Symptoms are usually read-only mode, boot looping, Unknown Device in device manager, or just generally funky stuff 

solution
legit just try another computer - I'm sorry. I really dont know a better alternative at this time 

### Bulkmode Failed while Flashing

Things to change to make it more likely to work:
- Use a externally powered USB hub.
- Use high quality USB-C cables.
- Try both a USB A-to-C and C-to-C cable.
- Directly connect to your motherboard USB ports.
- Try another computer.
- Disconnect unnecessary USB devices.
- Try a legacy flashing method.
- Attempt the flashing process again!

### Car Thing flashes successfully but doesn't get detected

The car thing is on the "Welcome to spotify" screen after flashing but not showing up in DeskThing.

- Always default to trying a new port (preferably one on the back of your PC) or a new cable!

- Try opening Device Manager and seeing if adb interface shows up (near the bottom). If it does, continue.

- If there is an Unknown Device - try a new port/cable or flashing again
