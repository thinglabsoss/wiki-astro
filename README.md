This is the ThingLabs Wiki Page - running on Starlight 

It is the collection of *almost* everything we have learned over the years of hacking the car thing. From setting it up, flashing, to uses. 

The domain situation is a bit.. odd.. but here are a few options to try:

https://carthing.wiki
https://thinglabsoss.github.io/wiki-astro/
https://wiki-astro.pages.dev
https://wiki.thinglabs.tech

Typical dev of doing, yknow, "npm install" and "npm run dev" to setup the development server as well in case all else fails. 

I don't get paid enough to formally make a README with proper styling so here is the brief:

- Changes should be made to branches to then get merged into the main page
- Please be clear about *what* you are changing / fixing / updating
- If else fails, you may have to contact us at https://tl.mt/d (the discord) and ping one of the admins and see if they respond


Thank you, and have a nice day. I appreciate you stopping by!

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   │   └── config.ts
│   └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
